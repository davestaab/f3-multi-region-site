# F3 Multi Region Website

## Overview

This project is a multi-region static website built with Nuxt 3. A single shared codebase powers multiple region-specific sites, each with its own content, configuration, and Netlify deployment. Regions are built independently using a tenant-based build process, allowing for clear separation of content, simple deployments, and scalable growth as new regions are added.

See `app/utils/tenants` for list of current regions.
